For efficient memory management during multiprocessing
- Do not declare `global var` in the functions the child processes are supposed to execute, because then var will be copied into the memory layout of each of the processes leading to multiple copies consuming a lot of RAM. Anyway in python you can access global vars directly from the function without declaring them as global in the function, access them in this way for efficient memory management (because ig in the background memory prep for the child processes, which is done via `fork` call, operates in CoW mode and when you directly access the global var without modifying it, there will only be one copy in memory)
