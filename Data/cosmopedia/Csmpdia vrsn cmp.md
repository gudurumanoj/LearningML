### Prompts 

- For source webpage
- Basic template: "Here is an extract from a webpage: {webpage}. {format} {target audience} {context}. {Instructions}"
	- *{format}* : blogpost, textbook etc
	- {target audience} : highschool, middleschool, children etc
	- {context} : list of topics/subtopics under which the text is to be generated
	- {Instructions} : do's and don't's for the model to generate text
- *context* and *webpage* are related to some degree but not too heavily
- In v2 prompts, 
	- *context* is further subdivided into a *small list of topics* (about 3-4) and a *subtopic*. List of topics is like a broad parent list the *subtopic* could possibly have
		- For ex: "Family and Community Bonds" (subtopic) as part of "JUVENILE FICTION / Holidays & Celebrations / Ramadan" (list of topics)
	- Instruction finetuning is different compared to v1
		- For ex: "Write an engaging and accessible course unit in a textbook for middle school students related to the extract above. The content should be tailored for middle school students without prior knowledge of the topic. Try to: - Provide detailed explanations, avoid technical jargon, and present the ideas in a straightforward, narrative tone. - Include examples to make the subject approachable and exciting for young middle school students. - Avoid mentioning the web extract in the textbook. Do not include a title or introductory phrases. Start writing the content directly"2 v "Instead of a traditional textbook approach, use a story-based narrative to explain the concept. Try to: - Avoid technical jargon and present the ideas in a straightforward, conversational tone to spark curiosity and relate to the experiences of a younger audience. - Include interactive elements like thought experiments and real-life scenarios. The goal is to topic approachable and fun, sparking curiosity about how it applies to everyday life. - Do not use introductory phrases such as "welcome to this unit" at the beginning or conclusions the end. Do not use images"1
		- For ex: "Think of a title for a WikiHow article within the domain of "CRAFTS & HOBBIES / Crafts for Children" that could be related to the extract above. Then write a long and very detailed tutorial about the title you chose, in the style of wikiHow. The content should have the following format: Title:<insert_chosen_title> new line <insert_wikihow_article>. Do not add any extra text explaining why you chose the title. Try to: - Include in-depth explanations for each step and how it helps achieve the desired outcome, including key tips and guidelines. - Ensure clarity and practicality in the wikiHow tutorial, allowing readers to easily follow and apply the instructions. Do not use images. - Choose a generic title that doesn't focus on irrelevant information in the web extract"2 v "Write a long and very detailed tutorial that could be part of WikiHow whose title is related to the extract above, within the context of "Football/Soccer". Include in depth explanations for each step and how it helps achieve the desired outcome, inluding key tips and guidelines. Ensure clarity and practicality, allowing readers to easily follow and apply the instructions. Do not use images."

Aim to: - Inform: Provide valuable, well-researched information that educates the reader. - Engage: Write in a conversational tone that connects with the audience, making complex ideas accessible. - Illustrate: Use examples, anecdotes, or personal experiences to bring the topic to life. Do not give a title and do not start with sentences like "Have you ever..." or "Hello dear readers..", simply write the content without these introductory phrases.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
